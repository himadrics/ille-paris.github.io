# **A new name, A new beginning...**

Over the past year, છાશ has become much more than just a place to read / write Gujarati in Paris. Today, our members come from all over India, and unite over their shared interest for indian languages and literature. It is about time to select a new name that better represents our diverse community. Hence, starting from today, we are going to call ourselves Indian Languages and Literature Enthusiasts in Paris (*ille_paris*). I would like to stress that it is not a mere name change. We are formally and sincerely committing to fostering a community that celebrates ALL indian languages. We are also proactively expanding our book collection to include more indian languages. 

# **Mobilizon, A new platform for managing our events**

During the last year, we relied on a properitory, and paid platform called Meet-Up to manage our events. They have  increased thier prices recently. Moreover, our experience with the organiser's app has been subpar, and our interactions with the the customer support team has also been unsatisfactory. Hence, we have decided to move to a free and open source alternative platform called [Mobilizon][mobilizon_link]. All of our upcoming events will be announced and managed there. Hence, we cordially invite you to join us on this new platform [@ille_paris][ille_paris_link].

# **Update on the online events**

Our pilot run with the online silent reading event was a success. However, my plate is quite full these days, so I would be unable to run the online events until the end of the year. In the meantime, if any of the regular members wants to take a lead on the online events, then please feel free to express your interest by dropping an email at *ille_paris@protonmail.com*.
