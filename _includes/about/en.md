Indian Languages and Literature Enthusiasts in Paris (*ille_paris*) was founded in early 2024 by Himadri Chhaya-Shailesh as a personal endeavour of proactively keeping in touch with her mother tongue - Gujarati. In its early days, this endeavour was called "છાશ - All things Gujarati", simply because her personal book collection was limited to Gujarati, which she made available to the community.

Primarily, we are a reading group, which sincerely executes a simple idea: 
1. Show up to decided place on time, and introduce yourself to the group. 
2. Bring your own book, or borrow a book from our collection. The book should satisfy at least one of the below criteria:
    - It is written in one of the Indian regional languages
    - It is a translation from one of the Indian regional languages
    - It is about India
    - The author is Indian or a person of Indian origin
3. Find yourself a seat, and read for a full hour in silence. 
4. Discuss about your impression of the book, and decide if you would like to continue it or not. 

In addition to Gujarati, છાશ soon started attracting readers for many other Indian languages, as well as foreign nationals interested in reading translations of Indian literature. After attracting 50+ members on the Meet-Up platform, and successfully organizing about a dozen such reading events in 2024, in order to better represents its sincere enthusiasm and commitment for ALL Indian languages, છાશ re-branded itself into *ille_paris* in January 2025. And more recently, the Indian Embassy in Paris has also formally recognized our endeavour, and welcomed us to the embassy's library.

Our participants come from all over India, from all age-groups, and from all walks of life. Just to give an example, at our usual reading events, you might find a mathematician reading a book on ancient Indian counting systems in Marathi, a software developer reading a book on the famine of 1899-90 in Gujarati, a data scientist reading a collection of folk-stories in Malayalam, a biologist reading short-stories in Hindi, a linguist reading essays about Darjeeling's urbanization is Bengali, and a mechanical engineer reading poems in Urdu. 

In addition to our reading events, we also plan on organizing book clubs, book recitals, writing groups, and in-person discourses between Indian authors and Indian readers. A plan to start our magazine that publishes the writings of the Indian diaspora in Indian languages is also under construction. You can follow us on social media, and RSVP for our upcoming events on Mobilizon. We are also looking forward to welcoming new members who share our enthusiasm and vision to join our executive council. If you would like to get involved, then please feel free to introduce yourself by dropping us an email at *ille_paris@protonmail.com*.
